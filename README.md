# Joris Valette - @jojva

Hi, I'm Joris ðŸ‘‹.

I'm currently working at [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) as a C++ engineer on the [Recommend product](https://www.algolia.com/products/recommendations/).

My previous job was at [Ineo Systrans](https://www.engie-ineo.fr/en/fichedd/engie-ineo-delegated-directions/ineo-systrans/), where I worked on a beautiful UI for passenger information systems ðŸšŒ.

## Personality and values

Curiosity is my main drive, both in life and at work. This is reflected in a passion for computer science, and natural sciences. I also love politics, although I will rarely talk about it.

I find a lot of happiness in the relationships I build at work, and as such I will always say yes to hanging out around a beer or two.

As for my values, I find those of Algolia - Grit, Trust, Care, Candor, Humility - to be close to what I try to apply everyday.

## How I work

I like to be in "the zone". Whenever I work on a topic, I'll be fully focused and try to avoid distractions as much as possible. That's why asynchronous messaging (e.g. Slack) is completely fine by me, because it lets me answer whenever I want.

Regarding processes, I try to be agile, although I don't know much about it and I'm mostly giving it my own interpretation (do small steps, iterate).

## Fun fact

I hold the world record at [Piou-Piou](http://www.kadokado.com/game/7/play).
